## Module description

This module manages PAM including accesslogin and limits.conf with
functionality to create limits fragments for use in other modules. There
are examples for using this with VAS/QAS.

## Setup

### What pam affects

Manages the packages and files regarding PAM. These vary by platform
though generally include things such as the following.

* `/etc/pam.conf`
* `/etc/pam.d`
* `/etc/security/access.conf`
* `/etc/security/limits.conf`
* `/etc/security/limits.d`

### Setup requirements
This module requires `stdlib`. When deployed by default it will require
`nsswitch`. See below for more information.

#### Optional

##### nsswitch

By default this module will include the `nsswitch` class with the
settings `pam::manage_nsswitch`. This module is meant to be used with
the Approved [nsswitch](https://github.com/trlinkin/puppet-nsswitch)
module.

##### SSSD

This module has been deployed in production along with
[sgnl05/sssd](https://github.com/sgnl05/sgnl05-sssd). Please see
`examples/hiera/sssd/RedHat-6.yaml` file for an example with the
additional SSSD entries added via hiera.

### Beginning with pam

Include the main `::pam` class.

#### Specifying the allowed users

##### Example using an array

As an array where the origin for each is 'ALL'.

```yaml
pam::allowed_users:
  - root
  - ops
  - devs
```

This would create `/etc/security/access.conf` with the following content.

```
# This file is being maintained by Puppet.
# DO NOT EDIT
#

# allow only the groups listed
+:root:ALL
+:ops:ALL
+:devs:ALL

# default deny
-:ALL:ALL
```

##### Example using a hash

As a hash where the user/group can optionally specify the origin.

```yaml
pam::allowed_users:
  'username':
  'username1':
    - 'cron'
    - 'tty0'
  'username2': 'tty1'
```

This would create `/etc/security/access.conf` with the following content.

```
# This file is being maintained by Puppet.
# DO NOT EDIT
#

#allow only the groups listed
+:username:ALL
+:username1:cron tty0
+:username2:tty1

# default deny
-:ALL:ALL
```

#### Setting limits
##### Example:

```yaml
pam::limits_fragments:
  custom:
    list:
      - '* soft nofile 2048'
      - '* hard nofile 8192'
      - '* soft as 3145728'
      - '* hard as 4194304'
      - '* hard maxlogins 300'
      - '* soft cpu 720'
      - '* hard cpu 1440'
```

This would create `/etc/security/limits.d/custom.conf` with content

```
# This file is being maintained by Puppet.
# DO NOT EDIT
* soft nofile 2048
* hard nofile 8192
* soft as 3145728
* hard as 4194304
* hard maxlogins 300
* soft cpu 720
* hard cpu 1440
```

#### Specifying the content of a service
Manage PAM file for specific service.

##### Example:
You can specify a hash to manage the services in Hiera

```yaml
pam::services:
  'sudo':
    content : 'auth     required       pam_unix2.so'
```

## Usage

Minimal and normal usage.

```puppet
include ::pam
```
