## Module description

This module manages PAM including accesslogin and limits.conf with
functionality to create limits fragments for use in other modules. There
are examples for using this with VAS/QAS.

## Setup

### What pam affects

Manages the packages and files regarding PAM. These vary by platform
though generally include things such as the following.

* `/etc/pam.conf`
* `/etc/pam.d`
* `/etc/security/access.conf`
* `/etc/security/limits.conf`
* `/etc/security/limits.d`

The management of `/etc/security/access.conf` can be controlled by the
`pam::manage_accesslogin` parameter (enabled by default).

The management of `/etc/security/faillock.conf` can be controlled by the
`pam::manage_faillock` parameter (disabled by default).

The management of `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` and `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d`
can be controlled by the `pam::manage_pwquality` parameter (disabled by default).

### Setup requirements
This module requires `stdlib`. When deployed by default it will require
`nsswitch`. See below for more information.

#### Optional

##### nsswitch

By default this module will include the `nsswitch` class with the
settings `pam::manage_nsswitch`. This module is meant to be used with
the Approved [nsswitch](https://github.com/trlinkin/puppet-nsswitch)
module.

##### SSSD

This module has been deployed in production along with
[sgnl05/sssd](https://github.com/sgnl05/sgnl05-sssd). Please see
`examples/hiera/sssd/RedHat-6.yaml` file for an example with the
additional SSSD entries added via hiera.

### Beginning with pam

Include the main `pam` class.

#### Specifying the allowed users

##### Example using an array

As an array where the origin for each is 'ALL'.

```yaml
pam::allowed_users:
  - root
  - ops
  - devs
```

This would create `/etc/security/access.conf` with the following content.

```
# This file is being maintained by Puppet.
# DO NOT EDIT
#

# allow only the groups listed
+:root:ALL
+:ops:ALL
+:devs:ALL

# default deny
-:ALL:ALL
```

##### Example using a hash

As a hash where the user/group can optionally specify the origin.

```yaml
pam::allowed_users:
  'username':
  'username1':
    - 'cron'
    - 'tty0'
  'username2': 'tty1'
```

This would create `/etc/security/access.conf` with the following content.

```
# This file is being maintained by Puppet.
# DO NOT EDIT
#

#allow only the groups listed
+:username:ALL
+:username1:cron tty0
+:username2:tty1

# default deny
-:ALL:ALL
```

#### Setting limits
##### Example:

```yaml
pam::limits_fragments:
  custom:
    list:
      - '* soft nofile 2048'
      - '* hard nofile 8192'
      - '* soft as 3145728'
      - '* hard as 4194304'
      - '* hard maxlogins 300'
      - '* soft cpu 720'
      - '* hard cpu 1440'
```

This would create `/etc/security/limits.d/custom.conf` with content

```
# This file is being maintained by Puppet.
# DO NOT EDIT
* soft nofile 2048
* hard nofile 8192
* soft as 3145728
* hard as 4194304
* hard maxlogins 300
* soft cpu 720
* hard cpu 1440
```

The parameter `pam::limits_fragments_hiera_merge` can be set to `true` to allow Hiera to define and merge limits from multiple locations.  Example:

```yaml
# data/common.yaml
---
pam::limits_fragments_hiera_merge: true
pam::limits_fragments:
  custom:
    list:
      - '* soft nofile 2048'
      - '* hard nofile 8192'
# data/os/RedHat/8.yaml
---
pam::limits_fragments:
  custom:
    list:
      - '* soft as 3145728'
      - '* hard as 4194304'
```

The contents of `/etc/security/limits.d` can optionally be purged of unmanaged files.

```yaml
pam::limits::purge_limits_d_dir: true
```

Below is an example of ignoring certain files from the limits.d purge:

```yaml
pam::limits::purge_limits_d_dir_ignore: 'ignore*.conf'
```

The ignore can also be an Array of file names

```yaml
pam::limits::purge_limits_d_dir_ignore:
  - custom.conf
  - foo.conf
```

#### Specifying the content of a service
Manage PAM file for specific service.

##### Example:
You can specify a hash to manage the services in Hiera

```yaml
pam::services:
  'sudo':
    content : 'auth     required       pam_unix2.so'
```

#### Manage faillock

Management of faillock and faillock.conf is enabled via `pam::manage_faillock`.

The following example would enable faillock, configure it, and add it to the PAM stack.

```yaml
pam::manage_faillock: true
pam::faillock::deny: 3
pam::pam_auth_lines:
  - 'auth        required      pam_env.so'
  - 'auth        required      pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=5 unlock_time=900'
  - 'auth        sufficient    pam_unix.so try_first_pass nullok'
  - 'auth        [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=5 unlock_time=900'
  - 'auth        required      pam_deny.so'
pam::pam_account_lines:
  - 'account     required      pam_faillock.so'
  - 'account     required      pam_unix.so'
pam::pam_password_auth_lines:
  - 'auth        required      pam_env.so'
  - 'auth        required      pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=5 unlock_time=900'
  - 'auth        sufficient    pam_unix.so try_first_pass nullok'
  - 'auth        [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=5 unlock_time=900'
  - 'auth        required      pam_deny.so'
pam::pam_password_account_lines:
  - 'account     required      pam_faillock.so'
  - 'account     required      pam_unix.so'
```

#### Manage pwquality

Management of pwquality and pwquality.conf is enabled via `pam::manage_pwquality`.

The following example would enable pwquality, configure it, and add it to the PAM stack.

```yaml
pam::manage_pwquality: true
pam::pwquality::retry: 3
pam::pwquality::maxclassrepeat: 4
pam::pwquality::maxrepeat: 3
pam::pwquality::minclass: 4
pam::pwquality::difok: 8
pam::pwquality::minlen: 15
pam::pam_password_lines:
  - 'password    requisite     pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass local_users_only difok=3 minlen=15 dcredit= 2 ocredit=2'
  - 'password    sufficient    pam_unix.so try_first_pass use_authtok nullok sha512 shadow'
  - 'password    required      pam_deny.so'
pam::pam_password_password_lines:
  - 'password    requisite     pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass local_users_only difok=3 minlen=15 dcredit= 2 ocredit=2'
  - 'password    sufficient    pam_unix.so try_first_pass use_authtok nullok sha512 shadow'
  - 'password    required      pam_deny.so'
```
